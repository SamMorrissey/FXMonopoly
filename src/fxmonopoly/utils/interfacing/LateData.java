 * This interface is aimed at enforcing a late data passing potential within
 * any implementing class. By this it refers to data that cannot be passed via
 * a constructor, but is necessary to be passed between different Scenes.
 * <p>
 * Within the context of this program the main usage is that of the GameController
 * class, which is passed initial data from the GameInitSettingsController. By 
 * implementing a method that returns a LateData object, the StageManager is able
 * to avoid exposing the Controller class to any unwanted manipulation.
